# Solid Rocket Motor(SRM) Safety

## Overview

This directory shall outline our Safety Management System(SMS) when it comes to designing and implementing our SRM, and set in place guidelines when it comes to careful, precise and accurate handling of equipment & chemicals, as well as their storage and disposal, used in crafting.

## What is a Safety Management System(SMS) and why is it necessary?

An SMS is, basically, a safety net when things go according to [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law). It's mostly used in Aviation and other critical systems like what we're building here at Nakuja. This is paramount and will save us a lot in terms of damages and catastrophic failures.  This sums it up.

There are 4 pillars of an SMS, namely:

- **Safety Policy**: The guiding principle and safety strategy
- **Safety Risk Management(SRM)**: The description, identification, assessment, analysis and control of the risk[^1]
- **Safety Assurance**: The evaluation of the defined/implemented policy
- **Safety Promotion**: Informing the team of the strategy and encouraging its implementation

[^1]: Yup. Fell for this trap, also. I almost ruined this repo for not asking beforehand. Note to self: ***Always countercheck your abbreviations and acronyms!***
